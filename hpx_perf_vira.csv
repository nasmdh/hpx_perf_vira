Looking at the logs, it seems like the memory allocation is related to CPC hal retry of initialisation. [More than one client|http://cs-stats.slipstream.volvocars.net/view/159816/analysis/CPU%2520Load%2520History?input=cloudmapreceiver%2C+vehicle_location_transmitter%2C+connectedsafety%2C+smart_charging%2C+installation_m&zoom=xaxis%3D7.331%252C180.622%26yaxis%3D-1.966%252C14.436%26xaxis2%3D7.331%252C180.622%26yaxis2%3D-1.000%252C4.000%26xaxis3%3D7.331%252C180.622%26yaxis3%3D-1.000%252C1.000%26xaxis4%3D7.331%252C180.622%26yaxis4%3D0.000%252C105.263%26yaxis5%3D21654619249.778%252C23879134094.222%26yaxis6%3D-21070381.213%252C21070381.213%26xaxis6%3D7.331%252C180.622%26xaxis7%3D7.331%252C180.622%26yaxis7%3D-55.611%252C1056.611] reports similar memory allocation and when we look at the logs, it seems quite closely related to CPC HAL retry activities such as the one below. Other than our components, we can see similar behaviour in smart_charging and installation_master for example

Hi,
 
 Can you share the logs?
 devb-ram is the qnx driver for RAM disk interface
 
 Are you using the RAM disk in production or is it only used for development testing?
 How are you using ram fs in your system when you see the dynamic allocation?
 - Are you creating files?
 - Are you writing to files?
 - Are you reading files?
 What parameters have you used when creating the RAM disk?;;;","2025-08-20 13:41;GASATI;Hi [~HARGEMID] / [~JRISO] ,

Can you please update this ticket with requests from Nvidia. This is Nvidia ticket for other internal ticket ARTCSIV-29119.;;;","2025-08-25 10:31;GASATI;Hi Patrik,

We got below update from QNX.

""I am not clear on the relation to devb-ram, but io-pkt does perform dynamic allocations (both malloc and mmap()). Most memory is associated with mbufs and clusters which is user data buffers. This can be configured on the io-pkt command line to come from typed memory. This typed memory can be limited size and dedicated to io-pkt. This will still appear to be a dynamic allocation in a kernel trace though up to the pre-determined size of the typed memory.

There are also background tasks that can dynamically allocate memory such as PF state objects or other smaller scale allocations. You could also have allocations in loaded 3rd party DLLs.

If used in combination with rlimit, current functionality allows for capping of memory, but there is not currently a mechanism to pre-allocate all required memory at the launch of the process such that there are no kernel calls attempting to allocate memory.""


*Based on this can Nvidia confirm that*
1: Typed memory is allocated to io-pkt at startup is within system limits.

2: rlimit for io-pkt is within system limits

Hi Gaurav,

I do not follow the reference to io-pkt here as far as I know devb-ram does not have any dependencies on io-pkt

But we suspect that the work that is done in COLLAB_VCNVIDIA-391 ([5167394](5167394)) can be related, let's re-evaluate this when we get the correction for io-blk.;;;","2025-09-05 10:45;MSANCHE1;Ticket has been migrated to the VCUv2 High context;;;","2025-12-05 09:39;N-JIRASY;[NVIDIA: Patrik Olesen @ 12/05/2025 12:39:05.92 AM]

Gaurav, 
 
 1. Please confirm what SW baseline and HW baseline is being used in this test?
 2. Is this test/bug reproducible with NVIDIA vanilla builds?
 3. Is this reproducible only with VCC Customized CSP QNX builds?
 4. Is this confirmed to be due to DRIVE OS or VCC Applications?
 
 Thanks;;;","2025-03-17 12:26;GASATI;hi Ravindra,

Updates inline.

1. Please confirm what SW baseline and HW baseline is being used in this test?

<Gaurav> Requested details.

SYSTEM: QNX

MACHINE: ARMv8_nVidia-Orin

RELEASE_VERSION: 7.1.0S DRIVEOS: 6.0.9.3-39008712-patch-01-5aca29ee74ef2af3aed8f40ea14b59fc46e927e8-prod_debug_extra-188888

2. Is this test/bug reproducible with NVIDIA vanilla builds?

<Gaurav> I am not sure if we can run NVIDIA vanilla builds on real cars. This is observed when we test cars in testing tracks. In CI/CD pipeline this is not observed.

3. Is this reproducible only with VCC Customized CSP QNX builds?

<Gaurav> As I cannot test this with NVIDIA vanilla builds, I am not sure if we can confirm on this.

4. Is this confirmed to be due to DRIVE OS or VCC Applications?

<Gaurav> As this is NVIDIA process, can you please help on how can I check this.  From VCC apps we ensure no new memory allocations/deallocations are there after platform is in run state.;;;","2025-03-17 12:40;N-JIRASY;[NVIDIA: Ravindra B S @ 03/17/2025 4:40:51.17 AM]
Gaurav, 
 
 Is there a small example or maybe a small test application which we can use to reproduce the issue locally at NVIDIA. If VCC is not sure that this can be reproduced with vanilla builds, we need alternative ways to reproduce this issue locally. 
 
 Thanks;;;","2025-03-21 14:42;GASATI;We used [this API|https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/p/procmgr_value_notify_add.html], with PROCMGR_VALUE_PRIVATE_MEM for each process memory change notification. It does not say anything specific to malloc and calloc but my very best guess it should capture both.
From one of other uploads as well we can see that when there is a disk access some memory is allocated and de-allocated. ufs0 is blue one and grey one is diagnostic kernel.

Hi,
 
 We are checking this with QNX and I will post here if we receive any updates.;;;","2025-04-25 10:41;MSANCHE1;Hello Manoj!

Providing an interim update here:
 
 1. The issue is root-caused towards Blackberry. 
 2. NVIDIA Team has filed a BB Support Ticket https://blackberry-bts.my.salesforce.com/500OI00000LFCWH and having discussion with BB Engineers further. 
 3. Main aim is to first root-cause which BB Library or SW Module is causing this memory leak. 
 4. Once BB provides some kind of experimental build, NVIDIA Team will run additional tests towards root-causing the issue. 
 
 Thanks;;;","2025-05-05 13:56;N-JIRASY;[NVIDIA: Ravindra B S @ 05/05/2025 4:56:14.49 AM]
VCC Team, Initial feedback received from BB on the Support Ticket. Summarizing their response below:
 
 ""After further investigation, found a few other slabs that are not pre-allocating memory during initialization. An internal ticket has been created to get these items looked at by our SMEs."".
 
 SO Blackberry is working further on root-causing the problem. 
 
 Thanks;;;","2025-05-05 16:18;GASATI;Hi Ravindra,

Is issue specific to nvhvblk or a generic one on how this is captured.

As we there are few other processes in QNX like io-pkt both SOCK4 and SOCK5, as well as for nvethernet manager

Gaurav, since this ticket is about hvblk, we are focusing only on that for now. 
 
 In case you have other observations with ethernet manager or io-pkt, can you please work with Blackberry directly to get their initial opinion. We would prefer that separate tickets are filed by VCC directly with Blackberry since io-pkt is a module directly delivered by Blackberry. 
 
 Thanks;;;","2025-05-14 08:47;EWOLLERT;As agreed on the bug scrub meeting yesterday, here is the link to the ticket we filed at BB: [https://blackberry-bts.my.salesforce.com/500OI00000M2toY.|https://blackberry-bts.my.salesforce.com/500OI00000M2toY];;;","2025-05-26 08:07;N-JIRASY;[NVIDIA: Ravindra B S @ 05/25/2025 11:07:05.63 PM]
VCC Team, we are yet to receive any feedback from Blackberry on this one. If this requires higher prioritization, requesting VCC Team to check with Blackberry directly and request them to investigate the root-cause of this issue further. 
 
 Thanks;;;","2025-08-22 11:33;MSANCHE1;As part of the 3-way meeting (VCC-QNX-NVIDIA) performed Aug 18th, an experimental patch from QNX will be delivered to NVIDIA to see if the hvblk issue has been fixed, request NVIDIA team to provide feedback in this ticket, thanks;;;","2025-09-03 11:15;MSANCHE1;Ticket migrated to VCUv2 High;;;","2025-11-24 15:59;MSANCHE1;Hello [~GASATI]!

Based on our Architect´s point of view, Per Svedberg, it was mentioned that: _VCC will not take this fix now. This will be part of NVIDIA DOS 7.x.x_

NVIDIA team, as previously agreed, we will keep this ticket open with Low priority until we get a solution in place.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 # There is no Error logs at all (AFW should throw error logs when app falls back to new_delete memory allocation): !image-2025-10-27-08-16-06-053.png!
 # In the pmap under the PID of hands-off-detection (872641) there is only one heap allocation that happens at application start [http://cs-stats.slipstream.volvocars.net/view/120798/slipstream/bundle/pmap]
 # In the PMR memory allocation details there is no mention about overallocated memory, moreover the hands-off-detection app has a lot of allocated memory left: !image-2025-10-27-08-15-35-705.png|width=998,height=577!

Could you point be directly where you see this memory allocation in logs? I the nuc I also cannot find anything.;;;","2025-10-31 14:25;GASATI;Hi [~JMIKUSEK] ,

This is captured using [https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/p/procmgr_value_notify_add.html] which triggers a notification for change in memory. We store this data in ring buffer for last 30 mins. I am not very sure if there is DLT log from CSP when new memory is alocated. 

This is out from pmap as that is executed when we run our scripts and it captures system memory at that instant. this is out of PMR allocations so we will not see data in PMR metrics. As this is from NUC cars which uploads data automatically, there is no clear steps on how to reproduce it.

 ;;;","2025-11-05 14:06;JMIKUSEK;While trying to reproduce FR, I've discovered that the hands-off-detection app creates additional thread associated with SignalComm which stack size corresponds with memory spike spotted in cs-stats (64KB)

This could probably be connected to the backup routine, which I tried to fix before. Maybe we are still doing some allocations there.

 

I will keep investigating it.;;;","2025-09-19 16:48;LMENDESM;The fix for this issue is to use sqlite backup API. In the past, we had problems with that (dbs being duplicated).

 

I went to the car and tested, and that issue is no longer there. With this new approach, there is no dynamic memory allocation being performed on critical use cases (factory reset / usage mode movable change)

 

I collected three different scenarios to check:

 

Usage mode movable change after changing a bunch of settings (settings will be written to disk when um movable OFF): [http://cs-stats.slipstream.volvocars.net/view/122045/analysis/CPU%2520Load%2520History?input=&zoom=xaxis%3D23.614%252C2028.640%26yaxis%3D-9.010%252C112.990%26xaxis3%3D23.614%252C2028.640%26yaxis3%3D-1.000%252C1.000%26xaxis4%3D23.614%252C2028.640%26yaxis4%3D-0.000%252C100.000%26yaxis5%3D-1.000%252C4.000%26yaxis6%3D-4484181.555%252C41925717.555%26xaxis6%3D23.614%252C2028.640]

 

First backup after a factory reset (all settings will be changed): [http://cs-stats.slipstream.volvocars.net/view/122032/analysis/CPU%2520Load%2520History?input=settings-service&zoom=xaxis%3D-47.768%252C1238.581%26yaxis%3D-1.520%252C20.286%26xaxis3%3D-47.768%252C1238.581%26yaxis3%3D-1.000%252C1.000%26xaxis4%3D-47.768%252C1238.581%26yaxis4%3D-0.000%252C105.263%26yaxis5%3D-1.000%252C4.000%26yaxis6%3D-64074554.145%252C681915194.145%26xaxis6%3D-47.768%252C1238.581] 

 

It seems that using the sqlite backup is a good candidate for a fix.

 

I also confirmed the settings are being persisted after each backup

Ineffective malloc breaks MEMORY_HOLD method.

*full:*
I dug around this memory hold method.
Basically, the malloc in our app does nothing in the current impl.
||No.||Description||Code||Allocation 
succeeds||Memory 
reserved||
|1|Current implementation|!image-2025-10-13-07-45-13-454.png!|No|No|
|2|Current impl with
the added print|!image-2025-10-13-07-45-51-274.png!|No|No|
|3|Pre-allocation in parts|!image-2025-10-13-07-47-16-427.png!|Yes|No|
|4|Pre-allocation in parts
write added|!image-2025-10-13-07-47-43-090.png!|Yes|*Yes*|

Conclusions [rlimit=50MB for each case]:
 * max possible single buffer to allocate is ~44 MB (hygiene_size has to be at last 7 MB)
 * max memory allocation using 1 MB buffers is ~46 MB (and system holds ~48 for it)
 * *memory is not actually reserved until it is written*

As stated in REQ-271378, no dynamic memory allocation is allowed during _run_ state. This could affect HW performance.

*Expected outcome:*

indicationmanager does not allocate memory while in _run_ state.

*Actual outcome:*
indicationmanager memory while in _run_ state.

*Where was the problem found (car, rig, simulation, assembly, etc.)?*

CSAI rig

*If reproducible, steps to reproduce:*
 # Powercycle VCU
 # Wait for all apps to be in _run_ state
 # Check memory allocation
 # Perform a drive cycle
 # Check memory allocation
 # Compare initial and final memory allocation for all apps

*Severity motivation:*

This issue prevents the correct verification of software updates, impacting the reliability of the system.

*Probability motivation:*

The issue has been seen twice in a row.

As stated in REQ-271378, no dynamic memory allocation is allowed during _run_ state. This could affect HW performance.

*Expected outcome:*

diagnostic_monitors does not allocate memory while in _run_ state.

*Actual outcome:*
diagnostic_monitors allocates memory while in _run_ state.

*Where was the problem found (car, rig, simulation, assembly, etc.)?*

CSAI rig

*If reproducible, steps to reproduce:*
 # Powercycle VCU & ADPM
 # Wait for all apps to be in _run_ state
 # Check memory allocation
 # Perform a drive cycle
 # Check memory allocation
 # Compare initial and final memory allocation for all apps

*Severity motivation:*

This issue prevents the correct verification of software updates, impacting the reliability of the system.

*Probability motivation:*

The issue is 100% reproducible.

As the ""REQ-271378"" isn't valid what is this fault about? Could you please describe why it is ""BLOCKING_REL""?

Could you answer/find answers to [~IRUBAN] questions?;;;","2025-07-25 08:36;JSOARE;[~IRUBAN] Both REQ-271378 and REQ-377586 state that memory allocation in RUN state is not allowed.

Both requirements are part of SRD-PC Provide Core System Integration and Configuration (SPA2.2) - 2.1 (NOTE-SRD-34290808-01-5) which is a formally released document.

Neither requirements are linked to specific application ASIL classification so the QM statement is not relevant.

*We will not close this fault report until the issue is fixed.*;;;","2025-07-25 09:47;DOCHERET;Work on this is ongoing. We are analyzing and cleaning up all potential places in Ethernet Diagnostics code that might allocate memory in RUN.

Currently split into three main tasks:
- *ARTHPP-28036* - Main investigation task: collecting all allocation cases, prepare log and test application.
- *ARTHPP-28058* - Fixes non-pcap allocations(std::function, unique_ptr, etc.) main part is already implemented and under review: [310266|https://csp-gerrit.volvocars.biz/c/csp/diagnostics_did_rid/+/310266]
- *ARTHPP-28063* -  Will move all pcap_* initialization to constructor so no allocations happen in RUN

Also writing a test app to help verify that nothing allocates at runtime.
More updates soon as we finalize and test the changes.;;;","2025-07-25 09:52;DOCHERET;Preliminary analysis shows that the *major source of dynamic memory allocations* is the 3rd party +*pcap*+ library, especially during:
- pcap_create()
- pcap_activate()
- pcap_compile()

Other functions like *pcap_setfilter()*, *pcap_next_ex() *or* pcap_sendpacket()* seem safe and do not allocate during runtime.

As a result, full raw socket communication init will be moved into the Diagnostics constructor (*ARTHPP-28063*) to avoid any allocations during RUN.
;;;","2025-07-25 11:40;IRUBAN;Hello [~JSOARE],
Tagged [~HWELLERG] .
Thanks for the clarification. HP Platform SW is implemented based on  ""SWRS HP Platform HPAv2 and HPB"". The SW REL10 is based on Revision: 009, CarWeaver link: url:swap://SystemWeaver:3000/x04000000045573D9.
Only requirements mentioned in the pointed SWRS are considered during HP Platform SW development. Both PC requirements (REQ-271378 and REQ-377586) likely weren't broken down to the HP Platform SW, so its implementation shall not be expected.
;;;","2025-07-25 13:36;JSOARE;Hi [~IRUBAN] 

It's a bit strange as neither of these requirements are new. REQ-271378 exists from mid 2023 and has evolved to the current version with the latest being for REL10. I'm not sure how the linking should be done to your SWRC.

For the one below, I talked to [~EKURUBA] and it was marked as OK to be part of the latest safety manual. There are already existing mentions in the current manual (see below). Regardless of the SWRC you mention, safety manual requirements shall be fulfilled.
|*REQ-377586*|Forbidden memory allocation in HPAA|B|HP Safety manual|*OK*|SS-SomeIp-Req_3,
SS-SomeIp-Res_4
SS-Log_Framework-Res_1,
SS-Performance_API-Res_1|

In any case, this is not new or unexpected demand, applications should not allocate memory in RUN state.

I see that work is currently on-going and a possible root cause has been found so let's continue the work to fix this issue.;;;","2025-07-28 09:50;IRUBAN;Hi [~JSOARE],
It isn't a new information that memory shall not be allocated at RUN. Mors is working at the issue with priority. My point was to highlight that this requirement wasn't handled in clear way to the HP Platform SW  from my POV.;;;","2025-07-29 10:46;JSOARE;I’ve synced with [~MDANIEL3] and we conclude that this fault report should not be release blocked based on the fact that pcap usage is done only in service on client side. The fault should be fixed anyhow, [~HWELLERG] please let us know when this is planned.

We should also probably talk about a specific design for pcap usage?

Regarding the memory allocation, we believe that RLIMIT should be enough to protect from memory exhaustion.;;;","2025-07-29 15:45;HWELLERG;Decreasing priority since issue was no longer considered safety issue and/or release blocker.

We currently estimate we can provide a fix merged to the ARTHPP baseline by 30/7.

{*}How is the customer (end customer, Manufacturing, Service, other ART etc.) affected?{*}:: Processes consuming more dynamic memory during the driving can lead the system run short of memory and ruin the system behavior.

{*}Expected outcome{*}:No processes should allocate any dynamic memory once the vehicle reached Usage mode Driving

{*}Actual outcome{*}: Application diagnostic_watchdog_monitor is found allocating dynamic memory once the vehicle is taken to driving

{*}Where was the problem found (car, rig, simulation, assembly, etc)?{*}:

Car XCP 1117
*Baseline:* P519_FCR1_724a_MH_RC_INT_V1

{*}If reproducible, steps to reproduce{*}:
 * Go for a long driving cycle 
 * Take the initial memory dump from the system at the start of Driving this included the details of each process and its memory allocation details 
 * Consecutive measurements are taken from the system during driving in a gap of 5-10 minutes.
 * Compare the memory dump with the initial measurements and see if any dynamic memory allocation is happened.

{*}Severity motivation{*}: 
ASIL B requirement hence high criticality

{*}Probability motivation{*}: The heap allocation is identified during means there is a code which allows this app to do so . It can repeat in other testing as well.
So probable to repeat

When an app crashes, diagnostic-watchdog-monitor will store 2 kinds of logs to RAM path /diagnostics/:
1. to store the statistical framework log, it will collect the data from shared memory and store the data to a file using std::ofstream and std::ifstream.
2. to store the dlt log, it will invoke a process named log_querier using the system function 'posix_spawn'.

I don't know what should be considered as acceptable and by design. What we see is this ""crash"" handling took 224 kB additional heap memory for one already allocated buffer/memory chunk - it doesn't look as new chunk of memory; increased memory chunk didn't decrease afterwards (many minutes after) which might point at memory leakage.... 

I think you can do tests with forced crashes and see how heap memory behaves for diag. watchdog monitor. If it continues to grow every crash handling - I think the issue is serious.;;;","2024-05-29 07:57;NLU3;Hi [~PMODILAY] , thanks for your analysis, that makes sense. 
I will do the test, but I do not know how to get the heap memory usage during the test. Could you please share any information/materials about how to get the heap memory usage info?

Thanks for the info.  I will try later.

By the way, do you have examples of allocating 'dirent' struct on PMR?;;;","2024-06-04 10:35;PMODILAY;[~NLU3] actually, I looked into the codebase and see readdir usage in other apps so the problem might be not in readdir in particular but simply leakage of memory in your case since you don't use closedir() in ./src/filedump_handler.cpp  IterateDirectoryHelper() 

In docs we can read: _You can call readdir() repeatedly to list all of the entries contained in the directory specified by the pathname given to opendir(). {*}You must call [closedir()|https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/c/closedir.html] to c{*}lose the directory stream and free the memory allocated by opendir()._

 ;;;","2024-06-04 10:39;PMODILAY;So, this appears to be layered problem. On the first layer is your particular case with memory leak (which somehow was not detected in unit tests?!), the second is more general for other apps that using readdir/closedir - they do allocate/free memory and this goes undetectable - let's bring that up in another FR... ;;;","2024-06-04 10:57;NLU3;[~PMODILAY]  Yes, we also found that we did not call closedir.

The issue could be completely solved by invoking the ‘closedir’ function if the read dir is not a shared memory path. But we tested and found that even if we invoked the ‘closedir’ function, the problem was not completely solved, this is because the dir we intend to read is /dev/shmem, which is a shared memory path. 

This is what we found: before invoking 'closedir', if one app crashes, the added heap memory will be 224kb, if another app crashes, another 224kb will be allocated. After invoking 'closedir', if one app crashes, the added heap memory will be 224kb, if another app crashes, no more heap memory will be added.;;;","2024-06-04 11:22;PMODILAY;[~NLU3]  ok, leaving aside closedir (which is indeed a bug), and yes, the 224 kb cannot be explained by missing closedir, instead there is some problem / design related issue with reading shared memory, I am not sure I understand the design to judge: I see file HPAStatisticalFramework_xxx.dmp is to be read in some callback but how I don't know (mmap/unmap?) - maybe it's not closed, or if closed - shared memory is not released and that's typical since caches need be flushed...  (found just there is forced call to flush caches: [https://support7.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.1/neutrino/lib_ref/c/cache_flush.html] )

 ;;;","2024-06-04 11:54;NLU3;[~PMODILAY] yes, we should solve the closedir issue.

And will appreciate if you help to find the rootcause/solution for the /dev/shmem readdir issue.

The design logic is: when an app crash is detected, diag_wd_monitor will search all the metrics_* files in /dev/shmem path, read the files and then store the content into /diagnostics/statistical_framework/HPAStatisticalFramework_xxx.dmp file(watchdog_statistical_fw_handler.cpp FetchStatisticalDataAndSaveToFile()
GetDirectoryMetricsContent()). To search the files in /dev/shmem path, diag_wd_monitor uses 'opendir’ ‘readdir’.
I think maybe the memory allocated by readdir was freed but not recycled by the system?;;;","2024-06-04 14:26;PMODILAY;[~NLU3]  well... I am not really a system developer, but just a troubleshooter..  (need to say that so we should find more knowledgeable in QNX  person) but as far as I understand the culprit in the implementation of

*Status WatchdogPersistentStorage::CopyFile(csp::pmr::string const& source_file_path,*
                                           *csp::pmr::string const& destination_file_path) const noexcept {*

where you open source and destination file in classic way as ifstream/ofstream, by doing that shared memory file is mapped to the process and doubt there is a way to force system release the mapping in this case even if the file is closed (in dtor), but this mostly statistical thing, OS would reclaim that indefinitely later, when it needs it, important that is that reference count is zero as should be in this case. 

In such a case we can vote for deviation to allow such grow with ceiling as you say, the ceiling would be 224kb x 2 on condition there is no growing at all after that.

Another option is to not use C++ I/O at all and even do one copy instead of two (file -> buffer -> file) with the help of mmap call, the idea is to mmap both files and then get addresses to memory to do memcpy() from one memory to another ...  e.g. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26582920/mmap-memcpy-to-copy-file-from-a-to-b]

Let me find someone for second opinion..;;;","2024-06-05 04:34;NLU3;Hi [~PMODILAY] thanks for your analysis and great suggestions, we will consider them in future updates.

Here is the design of diag_wd_monitor: [https://confluence.volvocars.biz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=549208162], hopefully can be helpful for your understanding.

In my testing, I found the heap allocation only happened when the dir is /dev/shmem"" and the allocation is inside the while loop:

 
{code:java}
DIR* dir = opendir(""/dev/shmem""); // no heap allocation if the dir is not ""/dev/shmem""
if (dir == nullptr)
{         
    return;     
}

struct dirent* dir_entry = readdir(dir);
while (dir_entry != nullptr)
{           
    dir_entry = readdir(dir); // no heap allocation if delete this line    
}
closedir(dir); {code}
So the heap allocation only happened when reading /dev/shmem dir through readdir, it had no relation to CopyFile process, because the trigger condition of file copy was not fulfilled(the persistent storage trigger happens when UsageModeConvinience changes to False and PlatformState changes to Failure).;;;","2024-06-17 10:45;NLU3;Hi [~PMODILAY]

As stated in REQ-271378, no dynamic memory allocation is allowed during _run_ state. This could affect HW performance.

*Expected outcome:*

data_forwarder_runner does not allocate memory while in _run_ state.

*Actual outcome:*
data_forwarder_runner allocates memory while in _run_ state.

*Where was the problem found (car, rig, simulation, assembly, etc.)?*

CSAI rig

*If reproducible, steps to reproduce:*
 # Powercycle VCU
 # Wait for all apps to be in _run_ state
 # Check memory allocation
 # Perform a drive cycle
 # Check memory allocation
 # Compare initial and final memory allocation for all apps

*Severity motivation:*

This issue prevents the correct verification of software updates, impacting the reliability of the system.

*Probability motivation:*

The issue is 100% reproducible.

can we do some change on the test enviroment then to reproduce it? 

to find the root cause, we need to change the plugins list that runner qm1 loading and reproduce it, finally locate which plugin allocates the memory, then code review with plugin owner to fix it. without enviroment to reproduce & debug it's very hard to do this.;;;","2025-11-10 10:18;HARGEMID;Hi [~LPATRIK1] & [~FYE4], as seen in the comments of the FR, this is happening in all baselines tested of release candidate branch 10.2, and were seen in master when we were testing it there, so if it has not been fixed it will still be present and it happens every time the VCU goes to UM Driving. We can provide our rigs as test environment as we have been doing for other developers trying to fix applications allocating memory such as yours. We could also provide contacts of other developers that have been successful fixing their issues as maybe they have information that would make it easier for you to identify what is going on.

Regarding the environment to test, you can merge your code to your master and make a patchset towards cs-software-product. That would let us build vbf that creates a blob in Victoria which we can trigger the automatic test on.

If you want to try reproducing the issue in you own environment, I can explain the check we are doing:
 * Turn on VCU and wait for all applications to be in ""RUN"" state
 * Check the initial memory allocated by all apps by running the following command in HPA: _hogs -i 1 -S -c -s 1 -l 64_
 * Go to UM Driving, get some speed, drive for 1 minute and park
 * Check the final memory allocated by all apps by running the following command in HPA: _hogs -i 1 -S -c -s 1 -l 64_
 * Compare the allocated memory of each app from the initial value that we got to the final one.

#1, download qnx100MB.img from [https://ara-artifactory.volvocars.biz/ui/repos/tree/General/ARTCSP-LTS/Csp_Debug/qnx100MB.img]  and csp_debug_startup_hook.sh

#3, comment out half of the current plugins as below

#4 restart VCU, check if the plugins're replaced: the replaced plugin size is 1

#5, test in dring mode and check the memory allocation, if still  new memory allocated, we can redo the test with commenting out half of corrent plugins.

by the way I cannot reproduce in the lab, in driving mode, but no signals.

{code:java}
Memory allocation during platform run state is not allowed as it may affect other applications in the system. The memory allocation violation will be set to BLOCKING_REL initially. However, if the allocation is justified the label may be removed.

To justify, explain: 

1. What is the max rate of allocations?

2. What is the max size of allocations? 

If the allocations have no upper bound, or the upper bound is unknown, in either rate or size, the issue is blocking. If there is an upper bound on both, explain them and assign the ticket back to us and we can remove the label. {code};;;","2025-11-18 12:33;CEKGRIM;[~NMAHMUD]  I have checked dlt log and can no longer seen message about ""AFW new_delete allocation attempt in state Run."".
